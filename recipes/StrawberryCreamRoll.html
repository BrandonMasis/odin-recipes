    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup hot water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup sifted all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>¼ cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream, chilled</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, for dusting (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a jelly roll pan. Line it with buttered foil or
            buttered parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs until thick and lemon colored. Gradually add 1 cup white sugar, beating constantly. Stir in
            water and vanilla extract. Fold in flour, baking powder, and salt. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake until cake is springy to the touch and beginning to shrink away from the sides of the pan, about 15
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Lay out a tea towel, and sprinkle it with confectioners' sugar. Turn the cake out on the towel. Peel off the
            paper or foil. Cut away crusty edges with kitchen shears or a sharp paring knife. Roll the cake up in the
            towel, and leave it to cool.</li>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and set aside. Wash and hull the
            strawberries; if they're large, you may halve or chop them. Melt gelatin in microwave, checking every 15
            seconds. Pour gelatin and 1 tablespoon sugar over strawberries.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream to medium-stiff peaks. Fold in cooled strawberry mixture. Unroll the cake, spread with the
            strawberry cream, and roll up again. Chill cake for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Before serving, dust cake with confectioners' sugar or top with additional whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
