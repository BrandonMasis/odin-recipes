    <h2>Toasted bread flavored with garlic and butter.</h2>

    <p>The garlic and butter are usually spread onto bread that has already been baked rather than being incorporated
        into bread dough. The types of bread most often used when preparing garlic bread are a basic French baguette or
        baton or a long Italian white loaf. </p>
    <p>The bread loaf is cut lengthwise and split open, then buttered and covered with minced garlic or sprinkled with
        garlic powder or garlic salt. The loaf is wrapped in foil and is then heated in the oven to melt the butter so
        that the flavor of the butter and garlic is absorbed into the bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill to high heat.</li>
        <li>Mix together butter, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Spread the butter mixture generously on the baguette slices.</li>
        <li>Place slices on the preheated grill and cook until butter is melted and bread is lightly brown, about 30
            seconds.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.</li>
