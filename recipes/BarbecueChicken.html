    <h2>Grilled chicken covered in barbecue sauce.</h2>

    <p>Most BBQ baked chicken recipes call for the chicken to be baked first and the sauce added at the end. But in
        recipe testing, we found a better method. Baking the chicken in the BBQ sauce the entire time allows the sauce
        to thicken and become deliciously sticky. And don't worry about the crispy</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>12 chicken thighs, skin removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together the
            water, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Season with salt, mustard
            powder, and chili powder. Simmer the sauce for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken thighs into an oblong baking dish, and pour the sauce over them. Cover tightly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then reduce the temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C), and
            bake for one hour. Remove cover, stir and bake uncovered for 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
